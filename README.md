# Heck

project is divided in two parts : front and back

## Front
Just for a better frontend dev experience (dev it like a clement di grand thouars site)

## Back
This is a bit more complicated

1) You need to have nodejs installed and setup
2) Open your terminal in the "back" folder and type `npm install`
3) To run a dev server just run `npm run dev` in the back folder (or `node index.js`)
4) It should be up and running on port 3000

## Accessing via git
[See this git cheatsheet](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
