# Heck

project is divided in two parts : front and back

## Front
Just for a better frontend dev experience (dev it like a clement di grand thouars site)

## Back
This is a bit more complicated

1) You need to have nodejs installed and setup
2) Open your terminal in the "back" folder and type `npm install`
3) To run a dev server just run `npm run dev` in the back folder (or `node index.js`)
4) It should be up and running on port 3000

> We are using ExpressJS for the back end
> 
> - index.js is the entry point [See ExpressJs quick Guide](https://expressjs.com/) to understand
> 
> - Under /views are ejs files (just like html but with logic things)
> 
> - Under /public are static files (images, css, client-side js, ...)
